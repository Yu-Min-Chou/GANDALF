# GANDALF
Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning technique that allows devices to
collaboratively learn a shared prediction model while keeping all the training data
locally and thus enable more secured and accurate model training. However, the
convergence and accuracy of federated learning can be degraded by the non-IID
(non independent and identically distributed) data across all edge devices. Hence,
we proposed **a GAN-based Data Augmentation Learning Framework named GANDALF**, which aims to solve the non-IID problem by performing data augmentation
with GAN models based on a mediator-based system architecture

# Overview
The overview of the proposed framework is shown in below figure. This framework consists of three phases: 
Training GAN models, Data augmentation with GANs, and Training user model. In addition, our framework also introduces the mediator-based architecture, which brings optimizations and reduces overhead. 
The detail of the framework and mediator-based architecture are discussed below.

- Training GAN models
  - In this phase, we train multiple GAN models. At first, the clients with similar class distribution are grouped into the same group based on a clustering algorithm, and each group will be assigned a mediator. Next, each group trains a GAN model independently in parallel. In each group, the GAN model weight is passed between the clients and updated sequentially until it converges. Mediators in this phase are responsible for scheduling the training process of each group and returning the converged GAN model to the server.
- Data augmentation with GANs
  - In this phase, each client performs data augmentation with GAN models. After the first phase, the server already has multiple trained GAN models. Next, the server sends the appropriate GAN models to each client according to its class distribution. Then, each client performs data augmentation with received GAN models to replenish the minority classes. Considering the computation cost of data generation and randomness of GAN data augmentation, we design an algorithm used to calculate the amount of data that each received GAN model should generate to minimize the computation cost. Furthermore, we also combine GAN data augmentation with static data augmentation to handle the randomness of GAN data augmentation.
- Training user model
  - We train the model which solves the main task here. At first, we perform grouping, which makes the class distribution of each group as close to uniform as possible. Then each group will be assigned a mediator. Next, the server initializes the global model and broadcasts it to all mediators. After that, each group updates the received model weight independently in parallel. In each group, the model weight is passed between the clients and updated sequentially. Finally, the server aggregates the updated model weight of all mediators, performs weighted FedAvg, and updates the global model. Then the server broadcast the global model to all mediators again to start the next round of training. After several training rounds, we get a well-trained model at the end.
# Implementation

1. Data generation
    1. All data generation operations are implemented under ../GANDALF/data_generation
    2. Modify the config.py and set the path used to store the local datasets and the way splitting datasets
        1. For example, to generate local dataset with cinic10, just uncomment the parameter setting for cinic10 and comment out the parameter setting for emnist
        2. You can also change the path store the local datasets
        3. The parameter ***mode*** can be one of the options
            1. evaluation: just for normal evaluation as paper describe
            2. one_class, two_class, four_class: for n-class non-IID problem
    3. Besides generating local datasets, you can also call the function ***generate_shared_dataset*** to generate the globally shared dataset which used to reproduce the experiments of Data-sharing strategy, one of the baselines.
    
        ```bash
        python main.py // in data_generation
        ```
    
2. NATS
    1. All communication operations between clients, mediators, and the server are based on message queue(nats). Follow the instruction of the [doc](https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/introduction/installation) to install NATS
    2. To activate the nats server, execute the below command with nats.config, which sets suitable message size limit and pending threshold.
        
        ```bash
        nats-server --config nats.config
        ```
